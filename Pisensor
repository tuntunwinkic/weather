# For getting data from DHT22 Sensor on Raspberry pi


import Adafruit_DHT
 
# Set sensor type : Options are DHT11,DHT22 or AM2302
sensor=Adafruit_DHT.DHT22
 
# Set GPIO sensor is connected to
gpio=4
 
# Use read_retry method. This will retry up to 15 times to
# get a sensor reading (waiting 2 seconds between each retry).
humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, gpio)
 
# Reading the DHT22 is very sensitive to timings and occasionally
# the Pi might fail to get a valid reading. So check if readings are valid.
if humidity is not None and temperature is not None:
  print('Temp={0:0.1f}*C  Humidity={1:0.1f}%'.format(temperature, humidity))
else:
  print('Failed to get reading. Try again!')
